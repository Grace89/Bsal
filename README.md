## Abstract: 
Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) emergence caused salamander mass mortality across Europe, and to date, remains undetected in the United States. Here, we tested the Bsal susceptibility of eight wild-caught salamander species by inoculating individuals with a low and high dose. We found that Notophthalmus viridescens died quickly with severe BsalÂ¬-lesions distributed across the body and deep within the skin. In contrast, plethodontids sustained superficial Bsal infections with small numbers of Bsal-lesions limited to the head and lateral body. The two Eurycea wilderae individuals inoculated showed differing responses. We also found that Bd infection intensity did not drive Bsal infections. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that the most recent common ancestor of the genus Plethodon is tolerant, highlighting the variation in Bsal infection outcomes of Plethodontidae. Our results suggest that salamanders differ in their competence as Bsal-reservoirs, thus not all species will be equally affected, and management will need to be multifaceted.
